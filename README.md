# Image Colorization Using CNN and U-Net  
**A Machine Learning Project for Enhanced Image Reconstruction**

## Overview  
This project showcases the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **U-Net architectures** for image colorization. Leveraging these state-of-the-art deep learning models, we demonstrate the transformation of grayscale images into vivid, colorized versions. This project highlights how machine learning techniques can recreate the subtle interplay of light and color with remarkable accuracy.

## Features  
- **CNN Model**: Efficient spatial feature extraction for lightweight colorization tasks.  
- **U-Net Model**: Advanced encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections for precise image-to-image translation.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Quantified performance using MSE and SSIM scores.  
- **Visualization**: Side-by-side comparison of input, ground truth, and predicted outputs.
